# Ongoing Care Deck (Foundation graduation visit)

The deck for the **Ongoing Care** Menopause & Perimenopause Program — presented at the
Offboarding ("Graduation") visit that closes the Foundation Program.

> **Current state (Nov 4, 2026): v7, eighteen slides.** Rebuilt from the Ongoing Care Agreement
> (draft dated Nov 4, 2026, still marked for legal counsel review) and the Ongoing Care landing
> page (canvas "Ongoing Care Lander v2"), using the landing page's photos, engravings and silk loop.
>
> 1 Congratulations · 2 None of this was luck (receipt) · 3 The moving target (3-D hypothalamus) ·
> 4 What happens after week 12 (stop or continue) · 5 Keep feeling like yourself (silk) · 6 Care that
> keeps up with you (four promises + phone) · 7 When something changes (six engravings) · 8 Your next
> twelve months (five stops) · 9 The transition visit · 10 The body scan · 11 Member evenings ·
> 12 Your choice (Ongoing Care vs single visits) · 13 Pricing · 14 What it covers, and urgent care ·
> 15 Your plan, plainly (the terms) · 16 Your questions · 17 Keep your momentum · 18 Thank you.
> The year still comes before the price (Peter, Oct 21).
>
> **Sources for each claim:** prices, scope and terms come from the agreement; everything else
> follows the landing page's wording. If the agreement changes after legal review, update `CONFIG`
> in `app.js`, slides 14 and 15, and `cue-card.html`.
>
> Wording written for the deck, not taken from either source (for Peter's review): the sub-lines on
> slide 9, "The same InBody scan you had in Foundation" on slide 10, "Examples. Evenings are optional…"
> on slide 11, "Four of them comes to $1,300" on slide 13, "Illustrative screens" on slide 6, and the
> three next steps on slide 17 (the landing page's steps describe its web form; "No payment today" was
> left out because it isn't in the agreement). The landing page's testimonials are left out on purpose:
> CNO no-testimonials rule.
>
> Prep needs only **her first name + Strong/Modest** (`CONFIG.MINIMAL_PREP`). The
> questionnaire-driven results slides and their transcription fields are **paused** behind
> `CONFIG.QUESTIONNAIRE_SECTION` (currently `false`); flip it to `true` and uncomment the three
> paused cues in `cue-card.html` once questionnaire data can be pulled directly. A reminder is
> scheduled for **Nov 18, 2026**.

The deck for the Offboarding ("Graduation") visit: Cheryl types the patient's first name,
picks Strong or Modest, generates a personalized deck, presents it, optionally prints it to
PDF for the chart, and closes the tab. **Nothing is ever saved by this tool.**

Lives inside the `menopause-foundation-presentation` project and reuses its slide engine
(`../deck-stage.js`) and brand tokens (`../colors_and_type.css`).

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Prep form ("slide 0") + the deck slides (markup and all CSS) |
| `assets/lander/` | The landing page's photos, engravings and silk loop (local copies; `reception-bonsai` and `inbody-botanical` were upscaled) |
| `app.js` | Form logic, derivations, deck rendering, the silk loops (`loopVideos`), the slide-2 receipt count, the slide-3 stepper sync (`stages35`), the timed rows on slides 6 and 8 (`makeCycler`), the closing texture |
| `hypo3d.js` | The 3-D hypothalamus (`<hypo-3d>` custom element) — a self-contained, tree-shaken Three.js r186.1 bundle. Built from `src/` by `tools/build-hypo3d.sh`; see `HYPO3D.md` |
| `cue-card.html` | Printable presenter cue card (static, no PHI). **Presenter notes never render on the deck screen — it is shared with the patient** |
| `optimal-logo.js` | Vendored `<optimal-logo>` brand mark (zero network) |
| `fonts/` | Self-hosted Castoro + Public Sans (this route may not touch a CDN) |

## Operator flow (Cheryl)

1. Before the visit, open the route → prep form
2. Type her first name; pick **Strong** or **Modest** (Modest softens the road-ahead line)
3. **Generate** → present slides 1–18 with the printed cue card in hand (the pricing slide's figures are computed from `CONFIG`: $83 = yearly ÷ 12, $193 = monthly × 12 − yearly, $1,300 = four single visits)
4. Optional: `Cmd/Ctrl+P` → Save as PDF → file into the chart → **delete the local copy immediately**
5. Record the patient's decision in the booking system (this tool records nothing)
6. Clear & close — refresh also wipes everything

Keyboard: `←`/`→` navigate · click left ⅓ back / right ⅔ forward · `Esc` returns to the
prep form (form state kept until refresh/close). On slides 6 and 8 the rows step by themselves;
clicking a row or stop holds it instead of turning the page.

### Modes

- **Then-test** (no intake questionnaire on file): intake-side values are the retrospective
  ratings captured at the offboarding survey. Labels change, category rows hide, and the
  hormone-picture slide auto-skips. The deck stays complete-feeling, with no gaps.
- **Strong / Modest** (§5.4): Modest changes copy only — the road-ahead line on slide 3
  ("The moving target") leads with "Hormone care is iterative — the first 12 weeks tell us
  what to adjust next." (With the questionnaire section restored, Modest also retitles the
  results slide and neutralises its delta chip.)
- **Worsening guard**: if final flagged ≥ intake flagged, the form warns and suggests
  Modest; presenting Strong anyway requires ticking an explicit override.

### Demo mode

**Load sample data** fills the FAKE "Alex Sample" set (31→9 flagged, four categories, five
symptom wins including one deliberate non-mover to demo neutral styling). All demo values
live in `app.js` under `SAMPLE` and are marked FAKE.

**Modest-mode example** (for training): load sample data, then set intake 18 / final 14,
results mode Modest, categories e.g. Decreased Estrogen 46→31, Decreased Progesterone
41→28, Increased Cortisol 39→33 — a real-looking partial responder. Note the neutral delta
chip and the "what to adjust next" bridge.

### PDF export (§5.8)

Print produces one slide per page with an identifying footer on every page:
`{first name} · {visit date} · {template version}` — so the filed PDF is identifiable in
the chart and auditable against the template that produced it. Pages are the deck's native
16:9 size (the slide engine's print system); they scale cleanly onto Letter landscape via
the print dialog's fit-to-page. PHI in the printed PDF is fine — its only home is the chart.

## PHIPA constraints — audit checklist (N1–N6)

Re-verifiable in ~5 minutes. Run quarterly.

- [ ] **N1 — Zero PHI in the repository, ever.** Placeholder data is clearly marked FAKE.
  Check the working tree and full history for anything patient-like (swap in real first
  names if any are ever suspected):

  ```bash
  git grep -in --all-match -e "" -- graduation-ongoing-care | grep -iv "alex sample" | grep -iE "\b(dob|date of birth|ohip|health card)\b" ; \
  git log --all -p -- graduation-ongoing-care | grep -icE "\b(dob|ohip|health card)\b"
  ```

  Both should return nothing / `0`. Also confirm `SAMPLE` in `app.js` still says
  `Alex Sample` and is commented `FAKE`.

- [ ] **N2 — Zero network requests after page load; no runtime CDNs.**
  DevTools → Network → load `/graduation-ongoing-care/`, fill + generate + navigate all slides.
  Every request must be same-origin (fonts come from `graduation-ongoing-care/fonts/`; the 3-D
  model is the single local file `hypo3d.js` and generates every texture in code; the photos and
  silk loop are in `assets/lander/`). Filter by
  "3rd-party requests": must be empty.

- [ ] **N3 — No storage.** DevTools → Application → Local Storage / Session Storage /
  IndexedDB / Cookies for this origin: all empty after a full prep+present run. Also:

  ```bash
  grep -rniE "localStorage|sessionStorage|indexedDB|document\.cookie|serviceWorker|CacheStorage" graduation-ongoing-care --include="*.js" --include="*.html"
  ```

  Must return no matches (this README mentions the words; code must not).

- [ ] **N4 — No analytics, error-reporting SDKs, or form POST targets on this route.**
  There is no `<form action>`, no `fetch`/`XMLHttpRequest`/`sendBeacon`/`WebSocket` anywhere:

  ```bash
  grep -rniE "\bfetch\(|XMLHttpRequest|sendBeacon|WebSocket|EventSource|action=" graduation-ongoing-care --include="*.js" --include="*.html"
  ```

  (`\b` matters: Three.js's shader strings contain the GLSL function `texelFetch(`, which reads a
  texture on the GPU and is not a network call.)

- [ ] **N5 — All state in JS memory only; unload destroys it.** Refresh mid-prep: the form
  must come back empty.

- [ ] **N6 — The artifact is a form, not a record.** The chart is the sole system of record
  via the printed PDF. This tool has no save, no export other than print, no outcome
  tracking (decisions are recorded in the booking system).

## Template version

`CONFIG.TEMPLATE_VERSION` in `app.js` (shown in the prep header and stamped into every
printed page's footer). **Bump it on any change that alters rendered output**, so filed
PDFs stay auditable against the template that produced them. The cue card's pricing
line is static text — if prices change in `CONFIG`, update `cue-card.html` too and reprint.

## Open items (from the PRD)

- Severity-chip hex values (`--sev-*` in `../colors_and_type.css`) are harmonized with the
  brand but **pending confirmation against the branded PDF report's exact palette** (PRD
  open question 3). Swap the four values there if they differ.
- v2 auto-fill depends on the report generator exporting structured data (open question 1).
